# HackerEarth-Tag_Prediction
A Multi-label Text Classification Problem

This dataset is from HackerEarth. The Goal here is to come up with a model that predicts multiple tags (Such as Python, Javascript etc) associated with respect to a user's Question. 


The metrics chosen for this problem is F1 score which is combined score of Precision and recall.


Note: I'll update the notebook with required commenting soon..
